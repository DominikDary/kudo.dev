# Announcing KUDO 0.16.0

We are happy to release [KUDO v0.16.0](https://github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/releases/tag/v0.16.0), with focus on upgradeability, support for immutable parameters and a lot of other small improvements and bugfixes.

To see the full changelog and the list of contributors who contributed to this release, visit [the Github Release](https://github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/releases/tag/v0.16.0) page.

## Release Highlights

### KUDO Upgrades

Until recently, `kubectl kudo init` would simply apply the expected state to the cluster. This is now changed, from now on:

- `kubectl kudo init` will fail if it detects an existing KUDO installation to prevent accidental upgrades.
- You can use `kubectl kudo init --upgrade` to upgrade an existing installation.

The upgrade process will verify that the upgrade can be executed correctly, won't break installed operators, and - in later versions - may contain migrations and other features that have to be done in an upgrade. 

Run `kubectl kudo init --help` for more details.

### Immutable Parameters

Operators sometimes have the need to specify parameters that are effectivly immutable. For example the `NUM_TOKENS` parameter in the KUDO Cassandra operator can not be changed later. Until now it was not really possible to define a parameter as immutable. This has now changed, with KUDO 0.16.0 it is possible to define a parameter like this:

```yaml
  - name: NUM_TOKENS
    description: "The number of tokens assigned to each node."
    default: "256"
    immutable: true
```

This will prevent the user from ever changing the parameter value in an update to the instance. For more details about immutable parameter, take a look at [KEP-30](https://github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/blob/main/keps/0030-immutable-parameters.md).


### New Repository Index

The default repository when installing operators with KUDO is the community repository. Adding new operators to this repository has been greatly simplified with a new index of operators and a new community repository URL that is used starting with KUDO 0.16.

For more details have a look at the full article about the new [operators index](blog-2020-08-25-introducing-operators-index.md).

### YAML/JSON output

There are some more commands that now allow yaml/json output so it can be better used in scripts and tools:

`kubectl kudo plan status --output yaml`
```yaml
planStatus:
  deploy:
    lastUpdatedTimestamp: "2019-10-17T01:01:01Z"
    name: deploy
    phases:
    - name: deploy
      status: FATAL_ERROR
      steps:
      - message: error detail
        name: deploy
        status: FATAL_ERROR
    status: FATAL_ERROR
``` 

`kubectl kudo package verify --output json`
```json
{
  "errors": [
    "parameter \"Cpus\" has a duplicate",
    "parameter \"comma,\" contains invalid character ','",
    "\"operatorVersion\" is required and must be semver",
    "plan \"not-existing-plan\" used in parameter \"comma,\" is not defined"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "parameter \"Cpus\" defined but not used."
  ],
  "valid": false
}
```
