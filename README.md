# Kubernetes Template Project

The Kubernetes Template Project is a template for starting new projects in the GitHub organizations owned by Kubernetes. All Kubernetes projects, at minimum, must have the following files:

- a `README.md` outlining the project goals, sponsoring sig, and community contact information
- an `OWNERS` with the project leads listed as approvers ([docs on OWNERS files](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/owners.md))
- a `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlining how to contribute to the project
- the `code-of-conduct.md` from this repo, which outlines community behavior and the consequences of breaking the code
- a `LICENSE` which must be Apache 2.0 for code projects, or Creative Commons 4.0 for documentation repositories
